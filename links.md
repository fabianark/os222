1. [Symmetric vs. Asymmetric Encryption – What are differences?](https://www.ssl2buy.com/wiki/symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption-what-are-differences)<br>
It is about differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption in cyber security. It helps to differentiate and better understand the concept of using keys to encrypt data.

2. [Unix Permissions — The Easy Way](https://towardsdatascience.com/unix-permissions-the-easy-way-98cc19979b3e)<br>
It is about file permissions in Unix operating systems (Linux is also derived from Unix), including the explanation of the codes and examples. The explanation is quite simple and easy to understand, so that we could read the codes by ourselves and understand its meaning.

3. [SHA-256 Cryptographic Hash Algorithm](https://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/sha256.html)<br>
It explains the implementation of SHA-256 cryptographic hash in data security. This site could improve your knowledge on hashing and its difference compared to encryption which is a two-way function.

4. [Computer Operating Systems: OS Families for Computers](https://www.techlila.com/computer-operating-systems/)<br>
So you have learned about OS, but you might only know that there are only 3 operating systems that exist in this world (Windows, MacOS, and Linux). Here you can see a lot of other operating systems that exist (or existed) in this world and also the history behind it.

5. [PIONEERS OF SEMICONDUCTOR NON-VOLATILE MEMORY (NVM): THE FIRST FOUR DECADES](https://computerhistory.org/blog/pioneers-of-semiconductor-non-volatile-memory-nvm-the-first-four-decades/)<br>
A deep history of non-volatile memory from the oldest to the newest technology that we use right now. This might be great for those history geeks out there. Do you love history? World War II history? Meh, now try this kind of history!

6. [Disk Partitioning: The Good, The Bad, And The Techy](https://protostechnologies.com/blog/disaster-recovery-news/disk-partitioning-good-bad-techy/)<br>
Pros and cons of applying disk partition to a storage system. This could help us to decide whether we need to use disk partition or not. So please adjust the storage according to your needs. Nevertheless, it is not a necessary thing to do.
